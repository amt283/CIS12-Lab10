# CIS-12 Week 12, Lab 10

<b> NOTE:</b> My computer, surprisingly, doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities and I didn't realize it until working on 
this lab during the weekend, so unfortunately I wasn't able to get a list of Bluetooth devices in the area. I do have 
Bluetooth headphones I was planning on using, but unfortunately it just didn't work out. 

I plan to run this script on one of the school computers later this week to see it function the way it was supposed to,
but the program I'm turning in now uses default values so that way I could follow along with the lecture video.

Thanks!
